# Fooda Recommendations

This little script logs into Fooda, and finds things that are within the
corporate allowance the user might have.

Based on that limit, it builds several combinations of items that a user can
purchase. This is pretty helpful for folks that are not in the office, and might
want to give people the ability to purchase items.

## Usage

```bash
ruby app.rb
```
